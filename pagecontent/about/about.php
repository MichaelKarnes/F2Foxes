<h2 id="heading"> About Company F-2 </h2>
<br></br>
<p class="black"> Thanks for visiting the company F-2 website! Established in 1959, F-2 is the 
oldest active outfit in the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets. Our outfit motto is 
"All we do is win!", and we work hard everyday to live by that motto.
F2 is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) outfit, but we
have and support cadets from every major academic concentration. Last year, we won the
Jounie award for the best academic performance in the Corps. Additionally, F-2 exceeds
physical fitness and military inspection standards every year. Our main goals are to 
develop leaders for the 21st century, succeed academically, promote the Corps values,
and develop lifelong friendships. Our success is made possible through motivated cadets,
strong leadership, generous alumni, and supportive parents. We greatly appreciate
any and all support, and strive to improve every year. </p>

<p class="black">The current commanding officer is Cole Bishop from Little Rock, Colorado. </p>
